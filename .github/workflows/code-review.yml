            Review the code changes in this PR against our coding standards:

            ## Standards to Check
            - **Backend (Hono)**: Correct use of c.json(), proper error handling, environment variables
            - **TypeScript**: No any types, proper interfaces, typed props
            - **Style**: kebab-case files, no abbreviations, early returns, blank line before return
            - **Security**: No secrets in code, proper input validation

            ## Review Format
            For each file with issues:
            - List what's correct
            - Detail issues with line numbers
            - Categorize as critical or minor

            Be thorough but constructive. Focus on substantive issues, not nitpicks.
